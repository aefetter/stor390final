Final paper on Fake News Detectors for STOR390: Moral Machine Learning at UNC

The project explores the implementation and ethical implications of machine learning-based fake news detection using methods inspired by [*Advancing Fake News Detection: Hybrid Deep Learning With FastText and Explainable AI*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10477989) by Ehtesham Hashmi et al. The project demonstrates the feasibility of training machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and FastText, for fake news detection and examines normative considerations like transparency, user privacy, and consent.
